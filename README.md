# 🔐 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Project

##### 🪶 Introduction
Cryptography is an important technique in information security to protect data from unauthorised access. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is currently the most widely used and secure algorithm. AES is a symmetric algorithm that uses identical keys for encoding and decoding.
In Windows desktop application development, AES can be implemented using the C# programming language and the .NET framework, specifically through the System.Security.Cryptography package.

##### ⚡Implementation Objective

* Provide desktop applications designed for Windows OS a way to secure data.
* Implement the AES algorithm for file-based data encryption.
* Allow users to symmetrically generate encryption and decryption keys using their own keys that have been generated by the programme system.

##### 👇 Features

* Text encryption and decryption with user-specific keys.
* Encrypt and decrypt files (documents, images, etc.).
* Encryption results can be saved and reopened.
* There is no fixed key in the source code, so it is more secure.
* Compatible for offline use.
